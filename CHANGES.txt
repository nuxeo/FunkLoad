FunkLoad 1.15.0
------------------

:Package: http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/f/funkload/funkload-1.15.0.tar.gz

:github: https://github.com/nuxeo/FunkLoad/tree/1.15.0

:Released date: 2011-03-11


New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Now supporting emacs Org-mode_ text format as report output. This
  enable to edit a report as plain text and to produce professional
  PDF reports througth the Org-mode_ LaTeX export.

  Here is an example of a `PDF 
  <http://funkload.nuxeo.org/report-example/test_seam_java6.pdf>`_ and
  an `Org-mode report 
  <http://funkload.nuxeo.org/report-example/test_seam_java6.org>`_.

  You need to build the HTML report first::
  
    fl-build-report --html funkload.xml
    Creating html report: ...done: 
    /tmp/test_foo-20110304T160328/index.html
    # then create the org file
    fl-build-report --org funkload.xml > /tmp/test_foo-20110304T160328/index.org
    emacs /tmp/test_foo-20110304T160328/index.org
    # then export as PDF C-c C-e d 
    # refer to the org-mode site for latex exports requirements

* New `trend report
  <http://funkload.nuxeo.org/report-example/trend-report/>`_ to
  display evolution of performances over time. Just use the
  ``--trend`` option of the ``fl-build-report`` command.

* The credential server can serve a sequence. Using ``xmlrpc_get_seq``
  threads can share a sequence::

    from funkload.utils import xmlrpc_get_seq
    ...
    seq = xmlrpc_get_seq()

* Source migrated from svn to git, hosted in gigthub
  https://github.com/nuxeo/FunkLoad

* Bug tracker moving to github:
  https://github.com/nuxeo/FunkLoad/issues

* New site and documentation using sphinx: http://funkload.nuxeo.org/

* CPSTestCase and ZopeTestCase have been moved to the demo folder.

* Removing deprecated gdchart support, now relying only on gnuplot. Note that
  a mathplotlib support is on the TODO_ list.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fix #3: FunkLoad Failures Fail on Python 2.7
  https://github.com/nuxeo/FunkLoad/issues#issue/3

* Do not block on read content when content-length is null, patch
  submited by Bertrand Yvain.

* Fix monitoring network monitoring charts.

FunkLoad 1.14.0
------------------

:Package: http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/f/funkload/funkload-1.14.0.tar.gz

:Svn: http://svn.nuxeo.org/pub/funkload/tags/1.14.0

:Released date: 2011-02-14


New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Switch to Sphinx for documentation, this work is in progress, the
  draft can be found in
  http://funkload.nuxeo.org/sphinx/. Thanks to Ali-Akber Saifee.

* Support of HTTP PUT and DELETE method, provided by Ali-Akber Saifee.

* Distributed mode (beta), provided by Ali-Akber Saifee, visit the new
  FAQ
  http://funkload.nuxeo.org/sphinx/faq.html#how-to-run-multiple-bencher
  for more information.

* Support of the ``--simple-fetch`` option using the configuration
  file. This can be useful when using benchmaster
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/benchmaster. Just add ``simple_fetch = 1``
  in the bench section.

* Add setUpBench and tearDownBench hooks, they are called only once
  per bench before and after all cycles. 
  
  Note that these hooks are called only using ``fl-run-bench`` and no
  ``fl-run-test``.

  This comes in addition to the existing setUpCycle and tearDownCycle
  hooks that are run before and after each bench cycle.

* Enable to add metadata for a bench using addMetadata(kw), metadata
  are stored into the bench result file and are displayed on the bench
  configuration section. 

  A typical usage is to add metadata during setUpBench or
  tearDownBench hooks.

* Handling FunkLoad todo list with an Org-mode_ file TODO_, replacing 
  the old trac.

* Mark CPSTestCase as deprecated will be removed in 1.15.

* Mark GDChart support as deprecated, it will be removed in 1.15.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fix: ImportError are reported as IOError using ``fl-run-test``
  because FunkLoad is switching in doctest mode when ImportError occurs.
  Fixed by adding an explicit option to run doctest:
  ``--doctest``.

* Fix: xmlrpc_get_credential(host, port) and xmlrpc_list_credentials
  without a group parameter it raises a "TypeError: cannot marshal
  None unless allow_none is enabled".

* Fix: 303 Redirect is handled as an HTTP/1.1 request by apache using
  a keep alive connection while FunkLoad is HTTP/1.0. This add a 15s
  (KeepAliveTimeout) overhead.  Fixed by adding "Connection: close"
  header on 303. Thanks to Jan Kotuc.

* Fixing invalid diff report if the report contains Apdex information.


FunkLoad 1.13.0
------------------

:Package: http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/f/funkload/funkload-1.13.0.tar.gz

:Svn: http://svn.nuxeo.org/pub/funkload/tags/1.13.0

:Released date: 2010-07-27


New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Adding Apdex (Application Performance inDEX) on reporting. 

  The Apdex is a numerical measure of user satisfaction, it is based
  on three zones of application responsiveness:

    - Satisfied: The user is fully productive. This represents the
      time value (T seconds) below which users are not impeded by
      application response time.

    - Tolerating: The user notices performance lagging within
      responses greater than T, but continues the process.

    - Frustrated: Performance with a response time greater than 4*T
      seconds is unacceptable, and users may abandon the process.

  By default T is set to 1.5s this means that response time between 0
  and 1.5s the user is fully productive, between 1.5 and 6s the
  responsivness is tolerating and above 6s the user is frustrated.

  The T variable can be set using the ``fl-build-report`` option
  ``--apdex-T``.

  The Apdex score converts many measurements into one number on a
  uniform scale of 0-to-1 (0 = no users satisfied, 1 = all users
  satisfied).

  To ease interpretation the Apdex score can be converted to a rating:

  - Unacceptable represented in gray for a score between 0 and 0.5 

  - Poor represented in red for a score between 0.5 and 0.7

  - Fair represented in yellow for a score between 0.7 and 0.85

  - Good represented in green for a score between 0.85 and 0.94

  - Excellent represented in blue for a score between 0.94 and 1

  By looking at the Page stats in the report you can take the maximum
  throughput with a Good/Excellent rating as an overall performance score.

  Note that this new metric can be generated with old funkload results file. 

  Here is a report example:
  http://funkload.nuxeo.org/report-example/test_seam_java6/#page-stats

  Visit http://www.apdex.org/ for more information on Apdex.

* The selection of the best cycle to sort slowest requests in the report
  is found using the product of throuthput and apdex score instead of simple
  maximum.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* The recorder now maintain the order of input elements, patch submited by
  Martin Aspeli

* Fix unicode decode errors when merging reports when an error occurred on a
  page with unicode, patch submited by Martin Aspeli.
 
FunkLoad 1.12.0
------------------

:Package: http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/f/funkload/funkload-1.12.0.tar.gz

:Svn: http://svn.nuxeo.org/pub/funkload/tags/1.12.0

:Released date: 2010-05-26


New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``fl-build-report`` is now able to create a report using many result
  files. The goal of this feature is to create bench report for a
  distributed bench. To be merged the result files must have the same cycles
  and cycle duration.

* The hostname and python version is now logged in the result file.

* Try to use `psyco <http://psyco.sourceforge.net/>`_ if installed. Note
  that psyco works only on 32-bit system.

* Miscellaneous speed improvments: removing minimal sleep time between
  actions, removing useless logs.

* New ``--as-fast-as-possible`` or ``-f`` option to ``fl-run-bench`` to remove
  sleep any times between requests and test cases, this is equivalent to
  ``-m0 -M0 -t0``.

* New ``--enable-debug-server`` option for ``fl-run-bench`` command. This
  option run a debug HTTP server which exposes an interface using which
  parameters can be modified at run-time.

  Currently supported parameters:

  - http://localhost:8000/cvu?inc=<integer> to increase the number of CVUs,

  - http://localhost:8000/cvu?dec=<integer> to decrease the number of CVUs,

  - http://localhost:8000/getcvu returns number of CVUs.

  You can load a server and be able to change the number of concurrent users
  during the run without pre-specifying it through 'cycles' argument, this
  is usefull during debugging or profiling.

  This feature has been provided by Goutham Bhat.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed a missing semicolon in WebUnit patch, caused all cookies to be combined
  into one ubercookie, thanks to Gareth Davidson.

* Do not generate charts when there are no data available preventing:
  "RuntimeError: Failed to run gnuplot cmd: ... Skipping data file with no
  valid points" error when building a report.

* Fix report charts on OS X darwin, thanks to Ethan Winn and Arshavski
  Alexander.

:Released date: 2010-01-26

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Support https with ssl/tls by providing a private key and certificate (PEM
  formatted) to the new setKeyAndCertificateFile method. This feature has been
  provided by Kelvin Ward.

* Better win support:

  - Patch recorder to work on non linux os, enable TCPWATCH env variable to set
    the tcpwatch binary path, thanks to David Fraser.

  - Patch report builder to produce gnuplot chart on win, thanks to Kelvin
    Ward.

* Enable to view the request headers either using an api (method debugHeaders)
  or command line option ``-d --debug-level=3``.

* Support of WebUnit 1.3.9 (in addition of 1.3.8) this new version brings
  cookie max-age support.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixing gnuplot charts when concurrent users are not in ascending order or
  have duplicates. (like ``-c 1:10:50:10:1`` instead of ``-c 1:10:20:30``)

* Prevent ``fl-record`` to generate invalid python test case name.

* Fix regex to check valid resources urls, it was too restrictive.

* Fix cookie support, there was an extra ";" if there was only one cookie,
  thanks to Daniel Sward.

* Fixing filename in mime encoding when uploading a file using an absolute
  path.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Easier installation on Debian Lenny/Ubuntu 8.10, See INSTALL_.

* Support setuptools console_scripts entry point for funkload
  scripts. Thanks to Ross Patterson.

* Added a two sample buildout configurations: a minimal one that just
  contains what is necessary to run tests and a default one that also
  enables recording. Thanks to Tom Lazar.

* Added a ``--report-directory`` option to ``fl-build-report`` to set report
  directory path.

* Added a ``--label`` option to ``fl-run-bench`` which the report generator
  then appends to the output directory of the report. This is to make it
  easier to keep different bench runs apart from each other. Thanks to Tom
  Lazar.

* Added a ``--pause`` option to ``fl-run-test``, the test runner will wait for
  the ENTER key to be pressed between requests.

* Added a ``--loop`` option to ``fl-record``, this way it is easy to type a
  comment then hit Ctrl-C to dump the script and continue with the next action.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Only attempt to retrieve syntactically valid URLs links.

* Fix report generation for bench with only one cycle.

* Fix differential report average percent profit chart.

:Released date: 2008-11-07


New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Switch to `gnuplot 4.2 <http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/>`_ for charts
  generation. Gnuplot script and data are kept with the report enabling
  charts customization. No more gdchart charting woes.

* Enhanced charts displaying more information, view a `report example <http://funkload.nuxeo.org/report-example/test_seam_java6/>`_.

* New diff report option, comparing 2 reports is a long and error prone
  task, `fl-build-report` has been enhanced to produce a differencial
  report. This new feature requires gnuplot.

  To produce a diff report::

   fl-build-report --diff path/to/report-reference path/to/report-challanger

  View a `diff report example
  <http://funkload.nuxeo.org/report-example/diff_seam_java_6_vs_5/>`_.

* Post method handles custom data and content type. For example to post a
  xmlrpc by hand

  ::

    from funkload.utils import Data
    ...
        data = Data('text/xml', """<?xml version='1.0'?>
    <methodCall>
    <methodName>getStatus</methodName>
    <params>
    </params>
    </methodCall>
    """)
        self.post(server_url, data, description="Post user data")

* The recorder translates properly ``application/xml`` or any content type
  using the new ``Data`` class (see above exemple).

* New `test script
  <https://github.com/nuxeo/FunkLoad/tree/master/src/funkload/demo/seam-booking-1.1.5>`_

--------------

:Package: http://funkload.nuxeo.org/funkload-1.5.0.tar.gz

:Svn: http://svn.nuxeo.org/pub/funkload/tags/1.5.0/

:Released date: 2006-01-31


New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* # 1284_: TestCase: support of doctest

  There is a new FunkLoadDocTest class that ease usage of FunkLoad from
  doctest::

    >>> from funkload.FunkLoadDocTest import FunkLoadDocTest
    >>> fl = FunkLoadDocTest()
    >>> response = fl.get('http://localhost/')
    >>> 'HTML' in response.body
    True
    >>> response
    <response url="http://127.0.0.1:80//" code="200" message="OK" />


  If you use python2.4, the test runner ``fl-run-test`` is able launch
  doctest from a plain text file or embedded in python docstring::

     $ fl-run-test -v doctest_dummy.txt
     Doctest: doctest_dummy.txt          Ok
     -----------------------------------------------------
     Ran 1 test in 0.077s
     OK

  And the ``--debug`` option makes doctests verbose::

     $ fl-run-test -d doctest_dummy.txt
     ...
     Trying:
         fl = FunkLoadDocTest()
     Expecting nothing
     ok
     Trying:
         fl.get('http://localhost/')
     Expecting:
         <response url="http://127.0.0.1:80//" code="200" message="OK" />
     ok
     Ok
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ran 1 test in 0.051s
     OK

* Test runner can use a negative regex to select tests. For example if you
  want to launch all tests that does not ends with 'foo' ::

    fl-run-test myFile.py -e '!foo$'

* # 1282_: TestRunner: more verbosity

  The new ``fl-run-test`` option ``--debug-level=2`` will produce debug
  output on each link (images or css) fetched.

* Improve firefox view in real time by using approriate file extention for
  the content type.

* CPSTestCase is up to date for 3.4.0, use CPS338TestCase for a CPS 3.3.8.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* fix # 1278_: BenchRunner: UserAgent from config file is not set

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New ``--loop-on-pages`` option for ``fl-run-test``.

  This option enable to check response time of some specific pages inside a
  test without changing the script, which make easy to tune a page in a
  complex context. Use the ``debug`` option to find the page numbers. For
  example::

    fl-run-test myfile.py MyTestCase.testSomething -l 3 -n 100

  Run MyTestCase.testSomething, reload one hundred time the page 3 without
  concurrency and as fast as possible. Output response time stats. You can
  loop on many pages using slice -l 2:4.

* New ``--accept-invalid-links`` option for ``fl-run-test`` and
  ``fl-run-bench``

  Don't fail if css/image links are not reachable.

* New ``--list`` option for ``fl-run-test`` to list the test names without
  running them.

* # 936_: TestRunner: use regexp to load test

  New ``--regex`` or ``-e`` option for ``fl-run-test`` to filter test names
  that match a regular expression.

* # 939_: Browser: Provide an option to disable image and links load

  New ``--simple-fetch`` option for ``fl-run-test`` and ``fl-run-bench``.
